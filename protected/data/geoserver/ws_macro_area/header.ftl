Header section of the GetFeatureInfo HTML output. Should have the <head> section, and
a starter of the <body>. It is advised that eventual css uses a special class for featureInfo,
since the generated HTML may blend with another page changing its aspect when usign generic classes
like td, tr, and so on.
